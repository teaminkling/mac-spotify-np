Spotify Now Playing is a tool for macOS and Spotify used to extend functionality of Spotify Desktop. It:

- Creates a tray mini-player interface.
- Allows you to add tracks to your library and playlists from the interface.
- (Optionally) displays a notification in Notification Center.
  - Tested to be working on macOS 11.3.1 (Big Sur)!

## Installing

Download the `.dmg` file from the [latest release][latest-release], run it, and move the app to your 
system's `Application` folder!

Alternatively, you can use Homebrew:

> This will install the latest version from the [old version][old-version-repo], for now.

```
brew install spotify-now-playing
```

## Contributing

### Local Development

This is a typical Electron app and is relatively easy to run locally!

After cloning this repository, you must install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Since this app uses the Spotify API, you [must create and register an app][spotify-app-registration] in the Spotify 
Developer portal.

Once you have done this, rename `.env-example.json` (file in the root of this project) to `.env.json`.

Finally, start the app:

```
yarn start
```

If you are developing over this project and want to test the built app (the one generated by `electron-builder`):

- Rename `electron-builder-example.yml` to `electron-builder.yml`;
- Generate a token with repo/scope permission [here][github-new-token], _only_ in case you want to release to your 
  GitHub repo. Remember to update the link to your repo in `package.json`.

To distribute a binary release:

```
yarn dist
```

This will create a `.dmg` file in `dist/` (possibly a new directory).
