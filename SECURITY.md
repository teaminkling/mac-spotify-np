# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the software will be supported with security
updates. You can see all releases [here][releases-list].

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email me about any vulnerabilities that give an attack path for
any users of the application.

If a vulnerability can be patched by a minor/patch dependency update,
feel free to raise a GitHub Issue. Dependabot alerts are public anyway.

If you have a suggestion to generally harden security, feel free to raise
an Issue for that.

You can see all [security issues here][security-issues-url].
